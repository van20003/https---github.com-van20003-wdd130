<p>Hi, my name is James Vang. I am from Sacramento, CA. I have a family of 5 that includes
my wife and three kids and me. I am currently working towards my degree in Applied technology. 
Some of the things that I like to do is eat, play volleyball, cars, and play games with my kids.
I am excited to take this course during the semester and learn what I can.
